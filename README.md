# feather
A "hyper lightweight" LWJGL helper library that makes render code legible.

Feather allows you to quickly create the User Interface you have in mind,
without needing to know obscure OpenGL calls or complex rendering algorithms.

### Why?

OpenGL can be a little bit "Write Once, Read Never" for those who
don't make a habit of working with it on a daily basis.

If you're using LWJGL in a project and just want to write code to draw a UI
in a hurry *and* still be able to read the code later, this is the library for you.

Similarly purposed libraries such as Slick wrap complexity in even more abstraction-induced complexity.
Feather is all about *the basics.*

> **feather** is a library, not a framework

#### Main Features:
* Intuitive syntax
* Eliminates the need to directly interact with OpenGL for most tasks
* Get started drawing shapes or text immediately
* Produces readable code
